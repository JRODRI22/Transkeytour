# UI/UX Pro Max - Design Intelligence

Comprehensive design guide for web and mobile applications. Contains 50+ styles, 161 color palettes, 57 font pairings, 161 product types with reasoning rules, 99 UX guidelines, and 25 chart types across 10 technology stacks. Searchable database with priority-based recommendations.

## When to Apply

This Skill should be used when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**.

### Must Use

This Skill must be invoked in the following situations:

- Designing new pages (Landing Page, Dashboard, Admin, SaaS, Mobile App)
- Creating or refactoring UI components (buttons, modals, forms, tables, charts, etc.)
- Choosing color schemes, typography systems, spacing standards, or layout systems
- Reviewing UI code for user experience, accessibility, or visual consistency
- Implementing navigation structures, animations, or responsive behavior
- Making product-level design decisions (style, information hierarchy, brand expression)
- Improving perceived quality, clarity, or usability of interfaces

### Recommended

This Skill is recommended in the following situations:

- UI looks "not professional enough" but the reason is unclear
- Receiving feedback on usability or experience
- Pre-launch UI quality optimization
- Aligning cross-platform design (Web / iOS / Android)
- Building design systems or reusable component libraries

### Skip

This Skill is not needed in the following situations:

- Pure backend logic development
- Only involving API or database design
- Performance optimization unrelated to the interface
- Infrastructure or DevOps work
- Non-visual scripts or automation tasks

**Decision criteria**: If the task will change how a feature **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**, this Skill should be used.

- `bottom-nav-top-level` - Bottom nav is for top-level screens only; never nest sub-navigation inside it (MD)
- `adaptive-navigation` - Large screens (≥1024px) prefer sidebar; small screens use bottom/top nav (Material Adaptive)
- `back-stack-integrity` - Never silently reset the navigation stack or unexpectedly jump to home (HIG, MD)
- `navigation-consistency` - Navigation placement must stay the same across all pages; don't change by page type
- `avoid-mixed-patterns` - Don't mix Tab + Sidebar + Bottom Nav at the same hierarchy level

## Prerequisites

Check if Python is installed:

```bash
python3 --version || python --version
```

If Python is not installed, install it based on user's OS:

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install python3
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
winget install Python.Python.3.12
```

## How to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user requests any of the following:

| Scenario | Trigger Examples | Start From |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **New project / page** | "Build a landing page", "Build a dashboard" | Step 1 → Step 2 (design system) |
| **New component** | "Create a pricing card", "Add a modal" | Step 3 (domain search: style, ux) |
| **Choose style / color / font** | "What style fits a fintech app?", "Recommend a color palette" | Step 2 (design system) |
| **Review existing UI** | "Review this page for UX issues", "Check accessibility" | Quick Reference checklist above |
| **Fix a UI bug** | "Button hover is broken", "Layout shifts on load" | Quick Reference → relevant section |
| **Improve / optimize** | "Make this faster", "Improve mobile experience" | Step 3 (domain search: ux, react) |
| **Implement dark mode** | "Add dark mode support" | Step 3 (domain: style "dark mode") |
| **Add charts / data viz** | "Add an analytics dashboard chart" | Step 3 (domain: chart) |
| **Stack best practices** | "React performance tips"、"SwiftUI navigation" | Step 4 (stack search) |

Follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements

Extract key information from user request:
- **Product type**: Entertainment (social, video, music, gaming), Tool (scanner, editor, converter), Productivity (task manager, notes, calendar), or hybrid
- **Target audience**: C-end consumer users; consider age group, usage context (commute, leisure, work)
- **Style keywords**: playful, vibrant, minimal, dark mode, content-first, immersive, etc.
- **Stack**: React Native (this project's only tech stack)

### Step 2: Generate Design System (REQUIRED)

**Always start with `--design-system`** to get comprehensive recommendations with reasoning:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<product_type> <industry> <keywords>" --design-system [-p "Project Name"]
```

This command:
1. Searches domains in parallel (product, style, color, landing, typography)
2. Applies reasoning rules from `ui-reasoning.csv` to select best matches
3. Returns complete design system: pattern, style, colors, typography, effects
4. Includes anti-patterns to avoid

**Example:**
```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "beauty spa wellness service" --design-system -p "Serenity Spa"
```

### Step 2b: Persist Design System (Master + Overrides Pattern)

To save the design system for **hierarchical retrieval across sessions**, add `--persist`:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<query>" --design-system --persist -p "Project Name"
```

This creates:
- `design-system/MASTER.md` — Global Source of Truth with all design rules
- `design-system/pages/` — Folder for page-specific overrides

**With page-specific override:**
```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<query>" --design-system --persist -p "Project Name" --page "dashboard"
```

This also creates:
- `design-system/pages/dashboard.md` — Page-specific deviations from Master

**How hierarchical retrieval works:**
1. When building a specific page (e.g., "Checkout"), first check `design-system/pages/checkout.md`
2. If the page file exists, its rules **override** the Master file
3. If not, use `design-system/MASTER.md` exclusively

**Context-aware retrieval prompt:**
```
I am building the [Page Name] page. Please read design-system/MASTER.md.
Also check if design-system/pages/[page-name].md exists.
If the page file exists, prioritize its rules.
If not, use the Master rules exclusively.
Now, generate the code...
```

### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed)

After getting the design system, use domain searches to get additional details:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --domain <domain> [-n <max_results>]
```

**When to use detailed searches:**

| Need | Domain | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Product type patterns | `product` | `--domain product "entertainment social"` |
| More style options | `style` | `--domain style "glassmorphism dark"` |
| Color palettes | `color` | `--domain color "entertainment vibrant"` |
| Font pairings | `typography` | `--domain typography "playful modern"` |
| Chart recommendations | `chart` | `--domain chart "real-time dashboard"` |
| UX best practices | `ux` | `--domain ux "animation accessibility"` |
| Alternative fonts | `typography` | `--domain typography "elegant luxury"` |
| Individual Google Fonts | `google-fonts` | `--domain google-fonts "sans serif popular variable"` |
| Landing structure | `landing` | `--domain landing "hero social-proof"` |
| React Native perf | `react` | `--domain react "rerender memo list"` |
| App interface a11y | `web` | `--domain web "accessibilityLabel touch safe-areas"` |
| AI prompt / CSS keywords | `prompt` | `--domain prompt "minimalism"` |

### Step 4: Stack Guidelines (React Native)

Get React Native implementation-specific best practices:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --stack react-native
```

---

## Example Workflow

**User request:** "Make an AI search homepage."

### Step 1: Analyze Requirements
- Product type: Tool (AI search engine)
- Target audience: C-end users looking for fast, intelligent search
- Style keywords: modern, minimal, content-first, dark mode
- Stack: React Native

### Step 2: Generate Design System (REQUIRED)

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "AI search tool modern minimal" --design-system -p "AI Search"
```

**Output:** Complete design system with pattern, style, colors, typography, effects, and anti-patterns.

### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed)

```bash
# Get style options for a modern tool product
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "minimalism dark mode" --domain style

# Get UX best practices for search interaction and loading
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "search loading animation" --domain ux
```

### Step 4: Stack Guidelines

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "list performance navigation" --stack react-native
```

**Then:** Synthesize design system + detailed searches and implement the design.

---

## Output Formats

The `--design-system` flag supports two output formats:

```bash
# ASCII box (default) - best for terminal display
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "fintech crypto" --design-system

# Markdown - best for documentation
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "fintech crypto" --design-system -f markdown
```

---

## Tips for Better Results

### Query Strategy

- Use **multi-dimensional keywords** — combine product + industry + tone + density: `"entertainment social vibrant content-dense"` not just `"app"`
- Try different keywords for the same need: `"playful neon"` → `"vibrant dark"` → `"content-first minimal"`
- Use `--design-system` first for full recommendations, then `--domain` to deep-dive any dimension you're unsure about
- Always add `--stack react-native` for implementation-specific guidance

### Common Sticking Points

| Problem | What to Do |
|---------|------------|
| Can't decide on style/color | Re-run `--design-system` with different keywords |
| Dark mode contrast issues | Quick Reference §6: `color-dark-mode` + `color-accessible-pairs` |
| Animations feel unnatural | Quick Reference §7: `spring-physics` + `easing` + `exit-faster-than-enter` |
| Form UX is poor | Quick Reference §8: `inline-validation` + `error-clarity` + `focus-management` |
| Navigation feels confusing | Quick Reference §9: `nav-hierarchy` + `bottom-nav-limit` + `back-behavior` |
| Layout breaks on small screens | Quick Reference §5: `mobile-first` + `breakpoint-consistency` |
| Performance / jank | Quick Reference §3: `virtualize-lists` + `main-thread-budget` + `debounce-throttle` |

### Pre-Delivery Checklist

- Run `--domain ux "animation accessibility z-index loading"` as a UX validation pass before implementation
- Run through Quick Reference **§1–§3** (CRITICAL + HIGH) as a final review
- Test on 375px (small phone) and landscape orientation
- Verify behavior with **reduced-motion** enabled and **Dynamic Type** at largest size
- Check dark mode contrast independently (don't assume light mode values work)
- Confirm all touch targets ≥44pt and no content hidden behind safe areas

## Common Rules for Professional UI

These are frequently overlooked issues that make UI look unprofessional:
Scope notice: The rules below are for App UI (iOS/Android/React Native/Flutter), not desktop-web interaction patterns.

### Icons & Visual Elements

| Rule | Standard | Avoid | Why It Matters |
|------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **No Emoji as Structural Icons** | Use vector-based icons (e.g., Lucide, react-native-vector-icons, @expo/vector-icons). | Using emojis (🎨 🚀 ⚙️) for navigation, settings, or system controls. | Emojis are font-dependent, inconsistent across platforms, and cannot be controlled via design tokens. |
| **Vector-Only Assets** | Use SVG or platform vector icons that scale cleanly and support theming. | Raster PNG icons that blur or pixelate. | Ensures scalability, crisp rendering, and dark/light mode adaptability. |
| **Stable Interaction States** | Use color, opacity, or elevation transitions for press states without changing layout bounds. | Layout-shifting transforms that move surrounding content or trigger visual jitter. | Prevents unstable interactions and preserves smooth motion/perceived quality on mobile. |
| **Correct Brand Logos** | Use official brand assets and follow their usage guidelines (spacing, color, clear space). | Guessing logo paths, recoloring unofficially, or modifying proportions. | Prevents brand misuse and ensures legal/platform compliance. |
| **Consistent Icon Sizing** | Define icon sizes as design tokens (e.g., icon-sm, icon-md = 24pt, icon-lg). | Mixing arbitrary values like 20pt / 24pt / 28pt randomly. | Maintains rhythm and visual hierarchy across the interface. |
| **Stroke Consistency** | Use a consistent stroke width within the same visual layer (e.g., 1.5px or 2px). | Mixing thick and thin stroke styles arbitrarily. | Inconsistent strokes reduce perceived polish and cohesion. |
| **Filled vs Outline Discipline** | Use one icon style per hierarchy level. | Mixing filled and outline icons at the same hierarchy level. | Maintains semantic clarity and stylistic coherence. |
| **Touch Target Minimum** | Minimum 44×44pt interactive area (use hitSlop if icon is smaller). | Small icons without expanded tap area. | Meets accessibility and platform usability standards. |
| **Icon Alignment** | Align icons to text baseline and maintain consistent padding. | Misaligned icons or inconsistent spacing around them. | Prevents subtle visual imbalance that reduces perceived quality. |
| **Icon Contrast** | Follow WCAG contrast standards: 4.5:1 for small elements, 3:1 minimum for larger UI glyphs. | Low-contrast icons that blend into the background. | Ensures accessibility in both light and dark modes. |


### Interaction (App)

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Tap feedback** | Provide clear pressed feedback (ripple/opacity/elevation) within 80-150ms | No visual response on tap |
| **Animation timing** | Keep micro-interactions around 150-300ms with platform-native easing | Instant transitions or slow animations (>500ms) |
| **Accessibility focus** | Ensure screen reader focus order matches visual order and labels are descriptive | Unlabeled controls or confusing focus traversal |
| **Disabled state clarity** | Use disabled semantics (`disabled`/native disabled props), reduced emphasis, and no tap action | Controls that look tappable but do nothing |
| **Touch target minimum** | Keep tap areas >=44x44pt (iOS) or >=48x48dp (Android), expand hit area when icon is smaller | Tiny tap targets or icon-only hit areas without padding |
| **Gesture conflict prevention** | Keep one primary gesture per region and avoid nested tap/drag conflicts | Overlapping gestures causing accidental actions |
| **Semantic native controls** | Prefer native interactive primitives (`Button`, `Pressable`, platform equivalents) with proper accessibility roles | Generic containers used as primary controls without semantics |

### Light/Dark Mode Contrast

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Surface readability (light)** | Keep cards/surfaces clearly separated from background with sufficient opacity/elevation | Overly transparent surfaces that blur hierarchy |
| **Text contrast (light)** | Maintain body text contrast >=4.5:1 against light surfaces | Low-contrast gray body text |
| **Text contrast (dark)** | Maintain primary text contrast >=4.5:1 and secondary text >=3:1 on dark surfaces | Dark mode text that blends into background |
| **Border and divider visibility** | Ensure separators are visible in both themes (not just light mode) | Theme-specific borders disappearing in one mode |
| **State contrast parity** | Keep pressed/focused/disabled states equally distinguishable in light and dark themes | Defining interaction states for one theme only |
| **Token-driven theming** | Use semantic color tokens mapped per theme across app surfaces/text/icons | Hardcoded per-screen hex values |
| **Scrim and modal legibility** | Use a modal scrim strong enough to isolate foreground content (typically 40-60% black) | Weak scrim that leaves background visually competing |

### Layout & Spacing

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Safe-area compliance** | Respect top/bottom safe areas for all fixed headers, tab bars, and CTA bars | Placing fixed UI under notch, status bar, or gesture area |
| **System bar clearance** | Add spacing for status/navigation bars and gesture home indicator | Let tappable content collide with OS chrome |
| **Consistent content width** | Keep predictable content width per device class (phone/tablet) | Mixing arbitrary widths between screens |
| **8dp spacing rhythm** | Use a consistent 4/8dp spacing system for padding/gaps/section spacing | Random spacing increments with no rhythm |
| **Readable text measure** | Keep long-form text readable on large devices (avoid edge-to-edge paragraphs on tablets) | Full-width long text that hurts readability |
| **Section spacing hierarchy** | Define clear vertical rhythm tiers (e.g., 16/24/32/48) by hierarchy | Similar UI levels with inconsistent spacing |
| **Adaptive gutters by breakpoint** | Increase horizontal insets on larger widths and in landscape | Same narrow gutter on all device sizes/orientations |
| **Scroll and fixed element coexistence** | Add bottom/top content insets so lists are not hidden behind fixed bars | Scroll content obscured by sticky headers/footers |

## ANTI-AI-GENERIC DESIGN RULES

> **Purpose:** Every project generated by this system MUST look like it was designed by a professional,
> NOT like generic AI output. These rules are MANDATORY and override defaults.

### BANNED — Never use these in any project

| Element | Why It's Banned |
|---------|-----------------|
| Purple/pink/violet gradients as primary palette | Overused AI cliché; instantly signals "AI-generated" |
| Generic hero with centered laptop/phone mockup | Every AI landing page looks identical |
| Centered-everything layouts (all text + buttons centered) | Lacks visual hierarchy and intentional composition |
| Stock-photo-style hero illustrations | Generic, forgettable, and signals template-based design |
| "Gradient orbs" or floating blurred circles in backgrounds | Cliché of AI-generated pages; zero functional purpose |
| Generic "Get Started" / "Learn More" CTAs without context | Vague; professional sites use action-specific CTAs |
| Inter/Roboto/Arial as the only font | System-default feel; no personality or brand expression |
| Uniform card grids with identical styling on every section | Monotonous; lacks visual rhythm and content hierarchy |
| Rainbow gradient text on dark backgrounds | Overused AI aesthetic; rarely on-brand |
| Default Tailwind color palette without customization | `blue-500`, `gray-900` etc. look immediately like Tailwind defaults |

### REQUIRED — Every project MUST include these

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Industry-specific color palette** | Search `--domain color "<industry>"` and customize; never use raw Tailwind defaults |
| **Curated font pairing** | Use `--domain typography "<mood>"` to select display + body font pair from Google Fonts |
| **Purposeful animations** | Every animation must convey meaning (state change, feedback, spatial transition); no decorative-only motion |
| **Real content structure** | Use realistic placeholder content matching the project's domain; never Lorem Ipsum |
| **SVG icons** | Use Heroicons, Lucide, Phosphor, or Tabler icons; never emojis as UI icons |
| **cursor:pointer** | On ALL clickable non-link elements (buttons, cards, toggles, tabs) |
| **Hover/Focus states** | 150-300ms transitions on ALL interactive elements; visible focus rings for keyboard nav |
| **Dark mode from day one** | Design light + dark simultaneously using semantic color tokens; never retrofit |
| **Asymmetric layouts** | At least one section per page should break the grid (overlap, offset, diagonal flow) |
| **Custom accent color** | Derived from the project's industry/brand; never default `blue-500` |

### DESIGN DIFFERENTIATION TECHNIQUES

Apply at least 3 of these per project to ensure uniqueness:

1. **Signature animation** — One distinctive micro-interaction that becomes the brand's motion language (e.g., elastic buttons, morphing cards, parallax sections)
2. **Typography contrast** — Dramatic size difference between heading and body (e.g., 72px heading + 16px body)
3. **Color accent strategy** — One bold accent color used sparingly (< 10% of palette) for maximum impact
4. **Geometric motifs** — Custom SVG patterns, dividers, or backgrounds derived from the brand/industry
5. **Spatial drama** — Generous whitespace in some areas, controlled density in others; never uniform
6. **Contextual imagery** — Icons, illustrations, or photos specific to the industry, not generic stock
7. **Interactive depth** — Elements that respond to user interaction (hover reveals, scroll-triggered animations, cursor effects)
8. **Editorial layout** — Magazine-style sections with varied column widths, pull quotes, dramatic typography
9. **Material texture** — Noise, grain, glassmorphism, or surface materials that give depth beyond flat design
10. **Dark/light personality** — Dark and light modes that feel different (not just inverted) with mode-specific accent adjustments

## Multi-Stack Guidelines

> The original skill was React Native focused. This section extends to all major stacks
> so the design system applies regardless of the frontend technology used.

### React (Vite / CRA)

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Component isolation | One component per file; co-locate styles (CSS modules or Tailwind) |
| State management | Context + useReducer for shared state; avoid prop drilling > 2 levels |
| Performance | React.memo for heavy renders; useMemo/useCallback only when profiling shows need |
| Animation | Framer Motion for complex; CSS transitions for simple hover/focus |
| Icons | `react-icons` or `@heroicons/react` — never inline SVG strings in JSX |
| Dark mode | CSS variables + `dark:` Tailwind classes; `prefers-color-scheme` media query |

### Next.js (App Router)

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Server Components | Default to RSC; add `'use client'` only for interactivity |
| Image optimization | Always use `next/image`; never raw `<img>` |
| Font loading | Use `next/font/google` with `display: 'swap'` |
| Metadata | Use `generateMetadata()` for dynamic SEO |
| Layout nesting | Shared layouts via `layout.tsx`; don't duplicate navbars |
| Streaming | Use `loading.tsx` + Suspense for progressive rendering |

### Vue 3 (Composition API)

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Composables | Extract reusable logic into `use*` composables |
| Reactivity | `ref()` for primitives, `reactive()` for objects; never destructure reactive |
| Templates | Use `<script setup>` for clean single-file components |
| Animation | Vue `<Transition>` + `<TransitionGroup>` for enter/leave |
| Icons | `@iconify/vue` or `lucide-vue-next` |

### Nuxt 3

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Auto-imports | Components, composables, and utils are auto-imported — don't import manually |
| Data fetching | `useFetch()` / `useAsyncData()` for SSR-compatible fetching |
| Layouts | Use `layouts/` directory with `<NuxtLayout>` |
| Pages | File-based routing; use `definePageMeta()` for middleware/layout |

### Svelte / SvelteKit

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Reactivity | `$:` for reactive declarations; stores for shared state |
| Transitions | Built-in `transition:` directives (`fade`, `fly`, `slide`) |
| SvelteKit routing | File-based with `+page.svelte` / `+layout.svelte` |
| Load functions | `+page.ts` for universal load; `+page.server.ts` for server-only |

### Astro

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Islands | Use `client:load`, `client:visible`, `client:idle` for interactive islands |
| Content | Use Content Collections for typed Markdown/MDX content |
| Zero JS default | Astro ships zero JS by default; add framework components only when needed |
| Integration | Mix React/Vue/Svelte components in the same page |

### Angular

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Signals | Use Angular Signals for reactive state (v17+) |
| Standalone | Prefer standalone components over NgModule |
| Change detection | Use OnPush change detection by default |
| Animation | Angular Animations module for enter/leave; CSS for hover/focus |

### SwiftUI (iOS/macOS)

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| View size | Keep views < 50 lines; extract subviews aggressively |
| State | `@State` for local, `@StateObject` for owned observables, `@EnvironmentObject` for shared |
| Navigation | NavigationStack (iOS 16+) with `.navigationDestination` |
| Animation | `.animation()` modifier with spring curves; `.withAnimation {}` for imperative |
| Accessibility | `.accessibilityLabel()`, `.accessibilityHint()` on all interactive views |

### React Native / Expo

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Navigation | React Navigation 6+ with typed routes |
| Lists | FlashList for large datasets; never ScrollView with map for 20+ items |
| Gestures | `react-native-gesture-handler` for pan/swipe; never raw onTouchMove |
| Animation | Reanimated 3 for 60fps animations on the UI thread |
| Platform-specific | `Platform.select()` or `.ios.tsx` / `.android.tsx` file suffixes |

### Flutter

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Widgets | Extract widgets at 30+ lines; const constructors for immutable widgets |
| State | Riverpod for state management; avoid setState in complex screens |
| Animation | `AnimatedContainer` for implicit; `AnimationController` for explicit |
| Navigation | GoRouter for declarative routing with deep links |
| Theming | `ThemeData` with `ColorScheme.fromSeed()` for Material 3 |

### Tailwind CSS (any framework)

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Custom theme | Extend `tailwind.config.js` with project-specific colors, fonts, spacing |
| Components | Extract repeated class groups into components, not `@apply` |
| Dark mode | Use `darkMode: 'class'` strategy; toggle via JS |
| Responsive | Mobile-first with `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:` breakpoints |
| Arbitrary values | Use sparingly; prefer theme configuration over `w-[347px]` |

### shadcn/ui

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Cherry-pick | Install only needed components, not the entire library |
| Customization | Modify copied components directly — they're yours, not library code |
| Theming | Use CSS variables in `globals.css` for colors; update via theme |
| Composition | Wrap shadcn primitives in project-specific composites |
| Accessibility | shadcn components (built on Radix) handle a11y — don't override aria attributes |

### HTML + CSS (no framework)

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Semantic HTML | Use `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>` |
| CSS custom properties | Define color/spacing/font tokens as `--var-name` in `:root` |
| Grid/Flexbox | CSS Grid for 2D layouts, Flexbox for 1D alignment |
| Progressive enhancement | Core functionality works without JS; enhance with JS |
| Performance | Inline critical CSS; load non-critical CSS with `media` or `rel="preload"` |

---

## Web Pre-Delivery Checklist (all stacks)

Before delivering ANY web UI code, verify:

### Visual Quality
- [ ] No emojis used as structural icons (use Heroicons/Lucide/Phosphor SVG)
- [ ] Custom color palette applied (not default Tailwind/framework colors)
- [ ] Font pairing is intentional (display + body), loaded via CDN or framework font loader
- [ ] At least one section breaks the uniform grid (asymmetry, overlap, or editorial layout)
- [ ] Dark mode designed alongside light mode (not retrofitted)

### Anti-AI-Generic
- [ ] No purple/pink gradient as primary palette
- [ ] No centered-everything layout without clear hierarchy
- [ ] No floating gradient orbs or blurred circles as decoration
- [ ] CTAs are action-specific ("Start Free Trial", "View Pricing") not generic ("Get Started")
- [ ] At least 3 Differentiation Techniques applied from the list above
- [ ] Content structure uses realistic domain-specific placeholders, not Lorem Ipsum

### Interaction & Accessibility
- [ ] All clickable elements have cursor:pointer
- [ ] All interactive elements have hover/focus states with 150-300ms transitions
- [ ] Text contrast: 4.5:1 minimum (both light and dark mode)
- [ ] Focus rings visible for keyboard navigation
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` respected (disable/reduce animations)
- [ ] Responsive: tested at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px

### Performance
- [ ] Images: WebP/AVIF, lazy-loaded below fold, explicit dimensions
- [ ] Fonts: `font-display: swap`, preload critical fonts only
- [ ] No layout shift on load (CLS < 0.1)
- [ ] Bundle: code-split by route/feature where applicable
